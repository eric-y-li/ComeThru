Registration and Login
Users may first set up an account by registering with a username and a password which they must re-enter for confirmation. If the username is already taken,
a pop up message telling the user that the username is taken will appear and they will need to change it if they want to make an account. After registering,
a user may log in to their account using their username and password. They are then directed to our index which displays an interactive google map displaying
the events in our database that the user has permission to see. If you would like to change your password, there is a link to an html page at the bottom of the
index page under the map. Once this link is clicked, the user is brought to a page where they can input their old password and then their new one.

The Map
The index display an interactive google map. On the map, there are red markers that display events that users have added to our database and which the session
user is permitted to view. If you click a marker, the name of the event as well as any relevant information will appear.You may only view events that are
designated as public or have been created by a member of your crowd.

The Table
If you do not want to click through the map to find events, all of the events that you have permission to view are listed under table view in which all of the
relevant information of events is stored.

Post Event
If you would like to add an event to the map, simply go to the form "Post Event" and input the relevant information. If you do not input all the relevant
information, you will be prompted to do so. Once you add this event, it will appear on the map, as well on the table view of events. Who it appears to depends
on the privacy settings of the event. If you select the event to be "Public", then it can be viewed by all registered ComeThru users. However, if you
choose the "Only My Crowd" option, the event is only visible to you, the creator, and the members of your Crowd. Once you click on one of the nodes on the
map, there is a pop-up with the details of the event.

Friend Functionality
ComeThru has "friend" functionality which we refer to as one's 'Crowd'. If you wish to add a friend's account to your crowd, click on "Add to your Crowd" in the
navbar. This opens up an html form in which you must enter the username of your friend. If you enter the username of somebody who is already your friend, then
you will get an alert telling you so. If you enter a username that does not match any username in our database you will get an alert telling you so. If you
successfully enter a username, you will be redirected to the index and a "Crowd" request will have been sent to the username you entered.
To see "Crowd" requests people have made of you, click on "Requests" on the navbar. This displays all current requests, displaying the username of the sender
and then with accept and decline buttons. If you click accept, you will be redirected to the "Crowd" page where you can see your new friend added to the page.
If you click decline, the user is redirected towards index. In either case, the request is then deleted.
To see one's "Crowd", click on "Crowd" in the navbar. This will display all the usernames of the members of your "Crowd" accompanied by a delete button with
which you can delete a member from your crowd.
